Major milestones – 
• Onboarding London, Radiology, HVI, Lerner (Lerner is a longshot I think)
• Also investigate with support from Storage team about enabling NFS share monitoring
o Ask the business if it is necessary since it is application data and not usually accessed by individuals
Resources – We might need to add more storage capacity for our DB server due to the number and size of new sources we are and have added. We can have Varonis perform a sizing of our existing environment to help us determine what we should add to support our growth plans.
Backlog – I believe Robert already has a backlog/stories built for each of the three sites
Complete in 2023? – I think all but Lerner can be completed year without issue. I would keep your current percentages.

1. Develop research criteria/requirements 
2. What are the criteria questions GRC engages the research requester
a. Need to know what all reasons are for what you reviewed and why research is able to make exception due to Research's exception requirements
b. With the Research criteria/requirements, let's make sure they are complaint with a Cyber Review just to really understand the research criteria/requirements are cyber compliant
c. Understand when to engage Service Delivery Team and what little parts need to be reviewed for a Research Study (Compare requirements of why Research wouldn't need to go thru a protection Profile)
i. Why engage Service Delivery Team – Architecture
3. Review a full case on how the Research Study is reviewed by GRC and then how Service Delivery would look it over
a. Define what requirements are pertinent to Cyber compliance requirements
4. SLA's for Service Delivery Review – how long each section would take to let the requester know up front in the process
5. How to handle research device connection for an OT assessment – Technical Person needs help with and Clay Anderson
6. TPRA Questions  With Multiple third parties when and why would you do your TPRA….  What is the requirements 
7. EDSMC Criteria questions  Erin, Ed and Daryl will interview Dustin and get back to Research and GRC on how the process will work with each of our teams

2. We'd like to review a workflow for the process of how the request for research should come from and to Cybersecurity Advisory
3. We'd like to discuss a workflow for why each team is involved, who needs to follow-up with these teams for status: EDSMC, IRB, Research, GRC
a. At the end of the process, who needs to give final approval to go back to IRB
b. EDSMC gives their own approval and Cyber Advisory checks with Dustin Sarosy
c. Cyber Advisory checks in MetricStream for TPRA but any other approvals should come from GRC/Research for what type of approval – Our they just approving just the TPRA or what else are those teams approving
4. Why would research send Cybersecurity Advisory group any research study request to review what are the requirements
a. If Cybersecurity Advisory Team review is needed then is it because of PHI Data being handled, CCF transfer or access
5. The Research Requester is asking why now they have to go thru Cybersecurity Advisory Team for Review
6. What are Cybersecurity Advisory Team requirements to have Research/GRC (TPRA) come back to Advisory for review
7. Finally Create a workflow
8. Is it CCF Data
9. What are the HIPA and Hi-Trust requirements for research projects and research data
10. Who are Stakeholders
11. What are their roles (RACI)
12. Additional Risks assessing that we need to evaluate to the CCF
13. Where data stored
14. Does the Classification of Data change the due-diligence of review of risk
15. Technical Risks
16. Regulatory Risks or Requirements
17. Who has final approval GRC or Advisory
18. GRC if going to approve then how do they document the EDSMC approval to Advisory and Requester, what is the flow
19. Is EDSMC required and why, Does EDSMC know the follow of these additional requests are coming

•       Description of Request: Music therapists frequently create audio or video recordings of patient songs, that could include the patient and/or family members, their voices, or heartbeat recordings. We often provide copies of these patient artefacts on CD or USB, but it would be helpful to have an electronic means to deliver these things to pts. However, the files are sometimes large, so they cannot be attached in an email. OneDrive would be a great option, but at this time, we can only transfer files among CC employees. 
 
•       Timeline: As soon as possible? A few months ago, we got a request from a pt who lost access to their video to receive a new copy.
                            
Debbie has a use case for the Music therapy department (approximately 12 caregivers) requiring the ability to share 500 mb – 1 gb audio/video files to patients and their families. These uploads typically only occur once or twice per month. 
We discussed the possibility of utilizing Box for this use case, however, due to the content of the audio/video files, they would need to be stored in the Confidential or Restricted Confidential folders within Box. While exceptions to the external collaboration restrictions can be completed, the patients/families would be utilizing public email domains (gmail/yahoo/aol) which are not to be exempted. Therefore, Box is not a valid solution. (Also worth noting that the $25 chargeback is not feasible in this situation).

I can think of two options which might work for this use case. First, would be utilizing OneDrive (not sure if this is available for use yet or if there are any data type/file size/collaboration restrictions in place). Second would be the SFTP request process in Service Now. I'm not sure whom currently owns that process or if this would be a valid use case for it.

Is architecture able to assist Debbie with determining an approved solution for sharing these files with patients/families?

-Nephron has a UNIX daily backup via tape
-Used XML
-My SQL server is the database storage
 
The compliance risk of this study appears low based on the following factors:
 Only 9 enrolled participants at this time
 Full written informed consent
 A data usage agreement has been put in place
 Study was already IRB approved (14-893)
 The study is a long-term study that will continue in perpetuity, but is not likely to exceed 500 records
 A data usage agreement has been executed
 De-identified data (no PHI)

The request is to add use of an NIH-provided i-Pad to be given to and held by the research team at CCF to enter de-identified study questionnaire responses into.  From there, it is proposed that the response data be emailed to the sponsor.  
 My request is that you work with the vendor to 1.) configure secure CCF email on this iPad or propose a more secure and viable option; or: 2.) Work to see if it is possible to use a CCF-managed iPad instead that will be able to run the needed application(s) to facilitate the study; or 3.) See what other options are available; or 4.) Determine the best way to transfer from the iPad study data to a CCF computer and transfer to the sponsor in a secure manner

My name is David Hines.  I am the Manager of Network Services for Cleveland Clinic, with responsibilities including the Wireless Network.

We do not allow Personal devices on the network at this time.

In order to have a deice onboarded, it needs to be reviewed by Cyber Security Architecture, as well as my Wireless team.
We need to ensure that the device can safely join the network, and that it meets are standards for doing so.

Someone from Cyber will be in touch with you to discuss the process.
In the mean time, I will close the Incident.  If you still want to move forward, you will need to work through Cyber Security.
This is not an incident, which is defined as something that was working is not.  This better fits a Service request, which is something that you did not have, but want to add.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me directly.

Thank You!

This will function similarly to SIGNAL, if you know or are familiar with this (I am not). 

The situation will use a Vendor (Forward Health Group) software solution to facilitate this effort via connection to the Epic EMR, not to access patient data per se, but to study Clinician activities in the EMR.  However, there may be access to patient data established (I don't know and Katherine wasn't exactly sure on this either).  I kicked off a TPRM for Forward Health.

Description of Request:  Here is the message from the vendor:  We are doing a little bit of work in vetting some different options on how to establish an HL7 interface without having to use VPN tunnels.  We're basically planning to transmit over https and use a pre-shared token to secure the requests beyond what https does for us.  We are exploring this option to make our interfaces more reliable with the eventual goal of making our interface stack highly available.

We are trying to understand a couple of things about this approach: 

1) We are planning to add an access token to the actual HL7 message that allows for this additional security, would this be challenging to the add to the interface on the CC side?  We are thinking this could go either in a field in the message header or in a custom Z segment but are open to suggestions if something else makes better sense.
2) What does your information security team think about this type of an approach?

At this point we're just trying to get those couple of questions answered without doing any actual work.  Who on the CC side would be the best resources to go to in order to get thoughts about these items?

7/15- Success Criteria for pilot:
1.) 80% visit success rate
2.) Patient/Physician surveys with an average of 4 out of 5 rating
3.) Visit Volume: 200 pts or 3 months, whichever comes first (ideally, no less than 100 pts)
4.) Technical support availability &amp; wait times: 24/7 availability with 2 minutes wait times for  calls &amp; chat
7/5- The ask is for pilot for local ED&#39;s.  No cost for pilot. E Visit will do all of the support. No integration needed at this time. E Visit adjusts call to audio only if signal is weak. 
Data provided from AmWell shows a lower percentage of dropped/poor quality calls than the providers are reporting.
1)      The volumes are on the conservative side
2)      Our projected 5 year EBIDA is ~$15.8m
3)      2022 volumes only include the latter half of 2022
4)      The current 2022 financials only account for ~50% of patients who went through triage and does not account for ACO impact/shared savings

5) Provider feedback- “It seems like 1 out of 3 calls has video/audio issues.  Takes multiple attempts of reconnecting.  Also, the website is clunky.  As in the using the video will cover any patient info and you need to open up an additional page to have it visible. All this makes it somewhat user un-friendly.  And seems to make the EMS provider less likely to utilize us as it adds unnecessary time to the call.” 
“I’ve had several calls where the connection with audio or video or both failed, often with the video pixelated or frozen, making it difficult to communicate, or assess the patient.   It was necessary to make several calls to complete the visit.”
“One time ems had an iPhone so we did FaceTime which worked well... In general video quality is subpar even when not freezing or disconnecting.”
▪ Patient Safety –6/16 - Patient Safety returned a rating of &#34;mid-tier&#34;
▪ Revenue – list the specific revenue impact amount-Without the eVisit platform, ESI risks $420,000 in lost revenue due to poor video/audio quality of the current vendor and potential lost partnerships.
▪ Regulatory – list the impact and any associated dates action needed
▪ Executive Request – list the reason and the executive making the request

With more pairs in the system, the rise in matches will continue to climb, and that’s exactly what the APKD is working toward.
The goal is to get the transplant center personnel to refer patients to the alliance for paired kidney donation so we can match more people and save more lives.
The APKD uses a Nobel prize-winning algorithm, developed by Alvin Roth, to match one incompatible pair with another. A scoring rubric, developed by a team of healthcare professionals, is used help find the best possible match.
