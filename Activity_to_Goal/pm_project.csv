Patient Safety – has it been approved by the Patient Safety and Quality Leadership sub-committee? (required)Revenue – list the specific revenue impact amountRegulatory – list the impact and any associated dates action needed - ServiceNow modules must be implemented by Nov 30, 2023 in order to replicate current functionality provided today by the MetricStream platform. This includes tracking and reporting of enterprise risks, including all vendor risk as well as the effectiveness of the controls put in place to mitigate these risks.Executive Request – list the reason and the executive making the request - Don Sinko, Rohit Chandra, Matt Kull, and Vugar Zeynalov are assembling a cross-functional team to address third party risk as this has now moved to the #1 Cyber risk to the enterprise. The Board has also agreed that third party risk management must be a top priority for the organization."

<p>Egress will provide services to help CCF improve and streamline their secure email communication with key recipients in the UK. Egress will provide email encryption to CCF and crucially, will also provide flexible recipient access methods to make it easy for recipients to access the encrypted content. The products that Egress will provide to CCF are <em>Egress Prevent</em> and <em>Egress Protect</em> which are delivered together via one Outlook plug-in and work in synchrony to prompt/guide the sender on when they should encrypt and how to ensure the appropriate access method is selected (such as One Click Access). Egress integrates seamlessly with Outlook desktop and can also support OWA and mobile users too.</p>
