 Cybersecurity - Advisory COE (59 epics): Research Requests with Cybersecurity Service Delivery Team to Identify  Criteria/Requirements when Cybersecurity Should be engaged   - Cybersecurity Domain Epic: Next Steps
1. Develop research criteria/requirements
2. What are the criteria questions GRC engages the research requester
a. Need to know what all reasons are for what you reviewed and why research is able to make exception due to Research's exception requirements
b. With the Research criteria/requirements, let's make sure they are complaint with a Cyber Review just to really understand the research criteria/requirements are cyber compliant
c. Understand when to engage Service Delivery Team and what little parts need to be reviewed for a Research Study (Compare requirements of why Research wouldn't need to go thru a protection Profile)
i. Why engage Service Delivery Team – Architecture
3. Review a full case on how the Research Study is reviewed by GRC and then how Service Delivery would look it over
a. Define what requirements are pertinent to Cyber compliance requirements
4. SLA's for Service Delivery Review – how long each section would take to let the requester know up front in the process
5. How to handle research device connection for an OT assessment – Technical Person needs help with and Clay Anderson
6. TPRA Questions  With Multiple third parties when and why would you do your TPRA….  What is the requirements
7. EDSMC Criteria questions  Erin, Ed and Daryl will interview Dustin and get back to Research and GRC on how the process will work with each of our teams

Example:  E-Diary tells them how they

1. We'd like to review a RACI for each Team: Purpose of each team (parameters/boundaries of each team), definition of each process and how we work together and our responsibilities together: EDSMC, Cyber Assurance (GRC), Research Team, IRB, Cyber Advisory
2. We'd like to review a workflow for the process of how the request for research should come from and to Cybersecurity Advisory
3. We'd like to discuss a workflow for why each team is involved, who needs to follow-up with these teams for status: EDSMC, IRB, Research, GRC
a. At the end of the process, who needs to give final approval to go back to IRB
b. EDSMC gives their own approval and Cyber Advisory checks with Dustin Sarosy
c. Cyber Advisory checks in MetricStream for TPRA but any other approvals should come from GRC/Research for what type of approval – Our they just approving just the TPRA or what else are those teams approving
4. Why would research send Cybersecurity Advisory group any research study request to review what are the requirements
a. If Cybersecurity Advisory Team review is needed then is it because of PHI Data being handled, CCF transfer or access
5. The Research Requester is asking why now they have to go thru Cybersecurity Advisory Team for Review
6. What are Cybersecurity Advisory Team requirements to have Research/GRC (TPRA) come back to Advisory for review
7. Finally Create a workflow
8. Is it CCF Data
9. What are the HIPA and Hi-Trust requirements for research projects and research data
10. Who are Stakeholders
11. What are their roles (RACI)
12. Additional Risks assessing that we need to evaluate to the CCF
13. Where data stored
14. Does the Classification of Data change the due-diligence of review of risk
15. Technical Risks
16. Regulatory Risks or Requirements
17. Who has final approval GRC or Advisory
18. GRC if going to approve then how do they document the EDSMC approval to Advisory and Requester, what is the flow
19. Is EDSMC required and why, Does EDSMC know the follow of these additional requests are coming
20. SLA component (ex:  7Days)
21. Prioritization of request (official process)

 Cybersecurity - Advisory COE (59 epics): ESI Virtual EM Program - eVisit Software Platform - Cyber/Arch only: IT Ask: Complete an ARB and cyber review of the eVisit platform for the ESI Virtual ED program.  Looking to have eVisit replace AmWell as platform for telehealth calls.
7/15- Success Criteria for pilot:
1.) 80% visit success rate
2.) Patient/Physician surveys with an average of 4 out of 5 rating
3.) Visit Volume: 200 pts or 3 months, whichever comes first (ideally, no less than 100 pts)
4.) Technical support availability &amp; wait times: 24/7 availability with 2 minutes wait times for  calls &amp; chat
7/5- The ask is for pilot for local ED&#39;s.  No cost for pilot. E Visit will do all of the support. No integration needed at this time. E Visit adjusts call to audio only if signal is weak.
Data provided from AmWell shows a lower percentage of dropped/poor quality calls than the providers are reporting.
1)      The volumes are on the conservative side
2)      Our projected 5 year EBIDA is ~$15.8m
3)      2022 volumes only include the latter half of 2022
4)      The current 2022 financials only account for ~50% of patients who went through triage and does not account for ACO impact/shared savings

5) Provider feedback- “It seems like 1 out of 3 calls has video/audio issues.  Takes multiple attempts of reconnecting.  Also, the website is clunky.  As in the using the video will cover any patient info and you need to open up an additional page to have it visible. All this makes it somewhat user un-friendly.  And seems to make the EMS provider less likely to utilize us as it adds unnecessary time to the call.”
“I’ve had several calls where the connection with audio or video or both failed, often with the video pixelated or frozen, making it difficult to communicate, or assess the patient.   It was necessary to make several calls to complete the visit.”
“One time ems had an iPhone so we did FaceTime which worked well... In general video quality is subpar even when not freezing or disconnecting.”
▪ Patient Safety –6/16 - Patient Safety returned a rating of &#34;mid-tier&#34;
▪ Revenue – list the specific revenue impact amount-Without the eVisit platform, ESI risks $420,000 in lost revenue due to poor video/audio quality of the current vendor and potential lost partnerships.
▪ Regulatory – list the impact and any associated dates action needed
▪ Executive Request – list the reason and the executive making the request

Discussed with Dr. Graham getting testimonials/examples from our Virtual physicians and partners on the current platforms
7/1- As of 5/30/22 -- Dr. Shook and Matt Stanton approved this for ESI to move forward with as their priority recognizing some gaps in current platform, however, not an enterprise TElehalth solution to be evaluated at this time (the attached Virtual ED Platform Comparison PPT)
Summary:
 The project involves implementing a new eVisit software platform for the ESI Virtual ED program, replacing the current platform AmWell. The success criteria for the pilot include a visit success rate of 80%, positive patient and physician surveys, a minimum visit volume of 100 patients, and 24/7 technical support availability with short wait times. The data from AmWell shows lower dropped/poor quality calls than reported by providers. There is projected revenue of approximately $15.8 million over five years. Provider feedback highlights issues with video/audio quality and user-friendliness of the current platform. Patient safety and revenue are key considerations for the project. The project has been approved by Dr. Shook and Matt Stanton for ESI to move forward, recognizing some gaps in the current platform.

 Cybersecurity - Advisory COE (59 epics): CKID Chronic Kidney Disease in Children Prospective Study - Cybersecurity Domain Epic: • Name of Request: CKID Chronic Kidney Disease in Children Prospective Study
• Description of Request: Introduction of sponsor-provided iPad into study use to transfer study questionnaire data to sponsor
• Timeline: ASAP
• CCF Line of Business/Institute: Pediatric Institute
• Contacts:
o CCF Business Owner: Jennie Wahl (Pediatrics)
o CCF Project Manager: Jaclynn Grayson (Research Coordinator)
o CCF Technical Lead: Unknown at this time (per Mike Behl, Assurance)
o Vendor Contact: TBD – ladies mentioned above have more information
• Any documentation regarding this request See attached Word Doc that provides some technical details:
-Nephron data managemnet system sits behind John Hopkins firewall;
-Uses 128 bit encryption (web server Nephron is located) and uses SSL (uses Windows 200 file system security)
-Nephron has a UNIX daily backup via tape
-Used XML
-My SQL server is the database storage

The compliance risk of this study appears low based on the following factors:
 Only 9 enrolled participants at this time
 Full written informed consent
 A data usage agreement has been put in place
 Study was already IRB approved (14-893)
 The study is a long-term study that will continue in perpetuity, but is not likely to exceed 500 records
 A data usage agreement has been executed
 De-identified data (no PHI)

The request is to add use of an NIH-provided i-Pad to be given to and held by the research team at CCF to enter de-identified study questionnaire responses into.  From there, it is proposed that the response data be emailed to the sponsor.
 My request is that you work with the vendor to 1.) configure secure CCF email on this iPad or propose a more secure and viable option; or: 2.) Work to see if it is possible to use a CCF-managed iPad instead that will be able to run the needed application(s) to facilitate the study; or 3.) See what other options are available; or 4.) Determine the best way to transfer from the iPad study data to a CCF computer and transfer to the sponsor in a secure manner

When Assurance follows up on these, we will reference this as "CKID"; please reference this when referring to any individual work or demand items—it gets very difficult to keep up with statuses.


Summary:
 The project is focused on cybersecurity for a Chronic Kidney Disease in Children Prospective Study. The request is to introduce an iPad to transfer study questionnaire data to the sponsor. The compliance risk of the study is considered low. The project manager is Jaclynn Grayson and the technical lead is currently unknown.

 Cybersecurity - Advisory COE (59 epics): Music Therapist - PHI Transfer assistance - Cybersecurity Domain Epic: Name of Request: MT Audio and Video File Transfer to Patients

•       Description of Request: Music therapists frequently create audio or video recordings of patient songs, that could include the patient and/or family members, their voices, or heartbeat recordings. We often provide copies of these patient artefacts on CD or USB, but it would be helpful to have an electronic means to deliver these things to pts. However, the files are sometimes large, so they cannot be attached in an email. OneDrive would be a great option, but at this time, we can only transfer files among CC employees.

•       Timeline: As soon as possible? A few months ago, we got a request from a pt who lost access to their video to receive a new copy.
                          
Debbie has a use case for the Music therapy department (approximately 12 caregivers) requiring the ability to share 500 mb – 1 gb audio/video files to patients and their families. These uploads typically only occur once or twice per month.
We discussed the possibility of utilizing Box for this use case, however, due to the content of the audio/video files, they would need to be stored in the Confidential or Restricted Confidential folders within Box. While exceptions to the external collaboration restrictions can be completed, the patients/families would be utilizing public email domains (gmail/yahoo/aol) which are not to be exempted. Therefore, Box is not a valid solution. (Also worth noting that the $25 chargeback is not feasible in this situation).

I can think of two options which might work for this use case. First, would be utilizing OneDrive (not sure if this is available for use yet or if there are any data type/file size/collaboration restrictions in place). Second would be the SFTP request process in Service Now. I'm not sure whom currently owns that process or if this would be a valid use case for it.

Is architecture able to assist Debbie with determining an approved solution for sharing these files with patients/families?

Summary:
 The project involves finding a solution to transfer audio and video files created by music therapists to patients and their families. The files are too large to be attached in an email and the option to transfer files using OneDrive is only available for employees. Box is not a suitable solution due to restrictions on external collaboration. The options being considered are utilizing OneDrive (if available) or the SFTP request process in Service Now. Architecture assistance is sought to determine an approved solution.

 Cybersecurity - Advisory COE (59 epics): American Medical Association (AMA) Forward Health Group Epic Connection -Research - Cybersecurity Domain Epic: I have a situation that will need your review.  This came in as a study, but per my discussion with Katherine Bulava who submitted the review, she is not sure yet if this will be presented to the IRB for approval as a study or will be more of a quality project that won't need to go through the IRB—that is still being determined on their end.  This will function similarly to SIGNAL, if you know or are familiar with this (I am not).

The situation will use a Vendor (Forward Health Group) software solution to facilitate this effort via connection to the Epic EMR, not to access patient data per se, but to study Clinician activities in the EMR.  However, there may be access to patient data established (I don't know and Katherine wasn't exactly sure on this either).  I kicked off a TPRM for Forward Health.  Per this conversation, Dr. Boose would be the go-to person to get more specific info on both "study" activities and technology.

Info gathering
Would you please provide the following information to kick off the Cybersecurity Architecture engagement:

• Name of Request:  American Medical Association (AMA) Forward Health Group Epic Connection
• Description of Request:  See above – direct EMR connection to facilitate study/project
• Timeline:  As soon as feasible
• CCF Line of Business/Institute:  Staff Affairs Office

 Cybersecurity - Advisory COE (19 epics): (Cyber/Arch) Alliance for Paired Kidney Donation (APKD): This is a request is to have IT Cybersecurity review vendor software as outlined in the contract currently in CCF Legal Review
IT Ask:Cyber / Arch ReviewPriority Score: 51.08Sizing Score: 10.00Exception Criteria (if applicable):  · Threshold: Patient Safety/Revenue/Regulatory  · Justification Statement:  Q2 ETSC Pre-Defer State (if applicable):
By including those incompatible pairs in the paired donation registry, the APKD is seeing more than a 50% rise in matches. That means 50% more patients who are finding the gift of life. With more pairs in the system, the rise in matches will continue to climb, and that’s exactly what the APKD is working toward.
The goal is to get the transplant center personnel to refer patients to the alliance for paired kidney donation so we can match more people and save more lives.
The APKD uses a Nobel prize-winning algorithm, developed by Alvin Roth, to match one incompatible pair with another. A scoring rubric, developed by a team of healthcare professionals, is used help find the best possible match.

 Cybersecurity - Advisory COE (59 epics): Evaluation of alternative interface methodology from vendor partner - Cybersecurity Domain Epic: • Name of Request: Evaluation of alternative interface methodology from vendor partner.

Description of Request:  Here is the message from the vendor:  We are doing a little bit of work in vetting some different options on how to establish an HL7 interface without having to use VPN tunnels.  We're basically planning to transmit over https and use a pre-shared token to secure the requests beyond what https does for us.  We are exploring this option to make our interfaces more reliable with the eventual goal of making our interface stack highly available.

We are trying to understand a couple of things about this approach:

1) We are planning to add an access token to the actual HL7 message that allows for this additional security, would this be challenging to the add to the interface on the CC side?  We are thinking this could go either in a field in the message header or in a custom Z segment but are open to suggestions if something else makes better sense.
2) What does your information security team think about this type of an approach?

At this point we're just trying to get those couple of questions answered without doing any actual work.  Who on the CC side would be the best resources to go to in order to get thoughts about these items?

 Cybersecurity - Advisory COE (19 epics): Innovations - Occulus Set-Up (Tactical): Conferring with my architect, Shane Ricker, I believe that we need to huddle on a new approach to supporting these devices. A couple of the challenges that he is seeing are 1) dependency on Tech Mahindra as it relates to static IP addresses, 2) social media blocking policy (Oculus is owned and operated by Facebook), and 3) restricted user permissions on workstations.

The 2nd and 3rd challenges are practical for 80% of CCF environment but as you are seeing; pose challenges for the other 20%. I would like to propose the following to resolve the issues.

Tactically, provide us with users and workstation names for all remaining installations. We'll work with our ITD partners to get all of them installed and running. Keep in mind that we may see disruptions as Facebook/Oculus issues updates or changes to the software or backend interfaces.

Summary:
 This text is discussing a project related to cybersecurity and the setup of Occulus devices.

 DP - Data Lifecycle (P1): Continue to scale the Varonis implementation where applicable/throughout the environment: OKR Activity 278

Major milestones –
• Onboarding London, Radiology, HVI, Lerner (Lerner is a longshot I think)
• Also investigate with support from Storage team about enabling NFS share monitoring
o Ask the business if it is necessary since it is application data and not usually accessed by individuals
Resources – We might need to add more storage capacity for our DB server due to the number and size of new sources we are and have added. We can have Varonis perform a sizing of our existing environment to help us determine what we should add to support our growth plans.
Backlog – I believe Robert already has a backlog/stories built for each of the three sites
Complete in 2023? – I think all but Lerner can be completed year without issue. I would keep your current percentages.



Summary:
 This project involves scaling the Varonis implementation throughout the environment by onboarding various departments, investigating NFS share monitoring, and potentially adding more storage capacity for the DB server.
