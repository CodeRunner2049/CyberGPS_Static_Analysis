### Step 1: 
Project Goals Description:
- The goals involve protecting critical cloud tenets and scanning cloud vulnerabilities.
- Technical controls need to be tested and any gaps in technical control should be remediated.
- Case processing should be within the agreed SLA.
- Conduct IR Tabletop exercises to simulate insider threat scenarios.
- Contain and eradicate threats within the system.
- Ensure that user groups are subscribed to an Insider Threat program, and investigations are conducted within SLA.
- Ingest log sources into SIEM according to a plan.
- Detect, analyze threats, and conduct planned threat hunts with intelligence briefings.
- Process IOCs within SLA and conduct threat simulation exercises along with implementing recommended gap fixes.
- Ensure continuity plans are in place for critical systems recovery.
- Protect network devices, including the production network, DMZ, and perimeter.
- Remediate gaps within SLA for various devices like computers, infrastructure devices, and protect them accordingly.
- Implement role-based access for applications, custom-build application protection, and scan applications for vulnerabilities.
- Protect data in different forms like unstructured, structured, PHI/PII, PCI, proprietary & research, and business confidential.
- Review high-risk third parties and ensure they meet clean bill of health post-incident.
- Have protective measures for partners, community sites, digital partners, and M&A sites.
- Remediate any audit findings within the due dates and ensure compliance with regulations like PCI, HIPAA, GDPR, and HITRUST.
- Keep policies updated and manage exceptions within SLA.
- Register risks and reduce them to an acceptable level, assess projects, engage business units, ensure customer satisfaction, and measure capabilities with strategic governance reviews.
- Provide cybersecurity services, maintain efficiency in budget, and align with industry maturity standards (NIST) for various security functions.
- Offer classes/workshops, encourage participation in cybersecurity activities, build research labs, publish findings, and promote the organization as a preferred place to work.
- Provide secure authentication mechanisms and reduce password management overhead by centrally managing accounts and role-based training.
- Monitor phishing click-rates and ensure protection for caregivers, patients, and other stakeholders.

### Step 2: 
Project Task Semantic Meanings:
- WAF Request Review - This task involves reviewing a request related to Web Application Firewall (WAF).
- Minor Cybersecurity Secure Design and Engineering Service - This task involves providing minor cybersecurity services related to secure design and engineering.
- The request involves creating Wordpress-based informational sites for research projects, displaying information, and directing participants to appropriate forms. It also includes standard port and SSL configurations.

### Step 3:
Project Functionality/Purpose:
The project involves reviewing a request related to Web Application Firewall (WAF) and providing minor cybersecurity services for creating secure design and engineering services for Wordpress-based informational sites related to research projects.
