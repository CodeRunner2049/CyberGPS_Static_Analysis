Step 1: 
Project Goals Summary:
- The project goals encompass a wide range of cybersecurity measures and protections, including cloud security, technical control testing, threat containment, data protection, compliance (such as HIPAA and GDPR), risk management, and industry maturity based on NIST guidelines.
- Additionally, the goals focus on ensuring the security of various types of infrastructure, applications, data transactions, and devices.
- There are also objectives related to partner protection, audit compliance, cybersecurity services, strategic governance, customer satisfaction, budget efficiency, and various industry maturity metrics.

Step 2:
Project Task Summary:
- The project involves an IT Cybersecurity review of vendor software related to the Alliance for Paired Kidney Donation (APKD).
- The goal is to have transplant center personnel refer patients to the alliance for paired kidney donation to increase matches and save more lives.
- The project utilizes the Kidney Match system developed with PostreSQL, Adobe Lucee, and Python algorithms to facilitate kidney transplant matches efficiently and effectively within the APKD ecosystem.

Step 3:
The project aims to enhance cybersecurity by conducting an IT Cybersecurity review of vendor software utilized in the Alliance for Paired Kidney Donation. The main objective is to increase patient matches and save lives by encouraging transplant center personnel to refer patients to the APKD. The project leverages the Kidney Match system, encompassing sophisticated algorithms to match incompatible kidney pairs efficiently.
