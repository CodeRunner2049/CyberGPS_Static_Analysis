**Goals Description:**
- The goals list includes objectives related to cloud security, technical controls, incident response, insider threat programs, threat detection and analysis, threat intelligence, continuity plans, network and system protection, data protection, compliance, risk management, partner protection, audit findings remediation, policy management, M&A core protection, cybersecurity services, industry maturity based on NIST framework, and workforce training.

**Project Task Description Analysis:**
- The project involves IT Cybersecurity reviewing vendor software as outlined in a contract for the Alliance for Paired Kidney Donation (APKD). This review includes assessing the software for compatibility, safety, regulatory compliance, and patient data protection. The APKD aims to match incompatible pairs for kidney donation using a specialized algorithm developed by Alvin Roth. The technology used includes an AWS platform, PostreSQL database, Adobe Lucee middleware, JavaScript for data validation, SQL for matching algorithm, and Python for optimization algorithm. The project also focuses on achieving a 50% rise in matches and increasing referrals to the paired kidney donation alliance.

**Functionality/Purpose of Project:**
The project involves conducting a cybersecurity review of vendor software utilized by the Alliance for Paired Kidney Donation to ensure data security, regulatory compliance, and patient safety. The goal is to leverage advanced algorithms and technology to facilitate matching incompatible kidney donors and recipients, ultimately increasing the number of successful matches and referrals to the donation alliance.
