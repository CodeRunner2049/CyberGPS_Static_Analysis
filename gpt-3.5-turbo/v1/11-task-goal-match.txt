1. The project goals list focuses on various aspects of cybersecurity measures, including protecting critical cloud tenets, scanning cloud vulnerabilities, testing technical controls, remediating technical control gaps, processing cases within SLA, conducting IR tabletop exercises, containing and eradicating threats, subscribing user groups to Insider Threat programs, investigating insider threats within SLA, ingesting log sources into SIEM, detecting and analyzing threats, conducting threat hunts and simulations, processing IOCs within SLA, implementing threat simulation recommendations, ensuring continuity plans, recovering critical systems, protecting network devices, production networks, DMZ, perimeter, gaps remediation, protecting various types of devices, role-based access for applications, application protection, data protection, compliance management, vulnerability management, governance reviews, cybersecurity services management, budget efficiency, industry maturity assessments, and various other protection and management measures related to cybersecurity.

2. The project task involves the evaluation of an alternative interface methodology from a vendor partner in the cybersecurity domain. The task includes assessing the feasibility and challenges of adding an access token to HL7 messages to enhance security beyond using https for transmission. The evaluation aims to make the interfaces more reliable and highly available by securing the requests through a pre-shared token and HTTPS transmission instead of VPN tunnels.
