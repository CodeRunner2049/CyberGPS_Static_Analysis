Step 1: 
Project Goals Summary:
- The project goals aim to secure critical cloud tenets, scan and remediate cloud vulnerabilities, test technical controls, and implement recommendations to bridge control gaps.
- Additionally, the goals involve containing and eradicating threats, ensuring continuity plans, recovering critical systems, protecting networks, devices, applications, and data, and engaging in partner protection.
- The objectives also include complying with audit findings, maintaining cybersecurity services, achieving budget efficiency, and enhancing industry maturity based on NIST guidelines.
- Furthermore, the goals cover various aspects of data protection, compliance (such as HIPAA and GDPR), risk management, strategic governance, and customer satisfaction.

Step 2:
Project Task Summary:
- The project focuses on evaluating alternative interface methodologies from a vendor partner to establish an HL7 interface without VPN tunnels.
- The approach involves using HTTPS transmission coupled with a pre-shared token for additional security within the interface stack, making it highly available.
- Specific questions relate to adding an access token to HL7 messages and receiving feedback from the information security team about this security approach.

Step 3:
The project aims to evaluate alternative interface methodologies proposed by a vendor partner to establish an HL7 interface without VPN tunnels. This involves enhancing security by utilizing HTTPS transmission and pre-shared tokens to ensure additional security measures in the interface stack, thus increasing availability. Specific considerations include incorporating access tokens into HL7 messages and obtaining feedback from the information security team.
