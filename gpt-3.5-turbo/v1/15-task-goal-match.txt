### Step 1: 
The project goal list includes various goals related to cybersecurity such as cloud protection, technical control testing, threat detection, application protection, data protection, compliance, risk management, infrastructure protection, etc. 

### Step 2: 
The project task "CyberDNA - DS - Data Life Cycle & Security" involves activities like implementing Imperva for database security monitoring, updating database deployment processes for onboarding new databases into Imperva, prioritizing database onboarding based on risk classification, configuring Imperva to forward alert logs to SIEM, identifying databases with sensitive information, deploying data protection controls based on data classification, updating deployment processes to include database encryption, identifying communication methods for data transmission and encrypting communication lines, enforcing secure file transfer for attachments, recurring scans for unencrypted communications, managing data access roles, assigning data access tags, and enforcing access rights based on data tags.

### Step 3: 
The project aims to enhance data security and privacy by implementing and enforcing data protection controls throughout the data life cycle. This involves monitoring database activity, ensuring data encryption, protecting data communications, identifying and tagging sensitive databases, managing data access based on roles and tags, and enforcing access rights to sensitive data.
