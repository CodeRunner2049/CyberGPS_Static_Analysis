**Project Goals:**
- The project aims to protect critical cloud tenets, scan cloud tenets, remediate cloud vulnerabilities, test technical controls, and implement technical control gap recommendations.
- It also includes activities like case processing within SLA, conducting IR tabletop exercises, containing and eradicating threats, and ensuring user groups subscribe to the Insider Threat program as per plan.
- Moreover, the goals involve ingesting log sources into SIEM, detecting and analyzing threats, conducting planned threat hunts, providing threat intelligence briefings, and processing IOCs within SLA.

**Project Task:**
- The project task involves completing an ARB and cybersecurity review of the eVisit platform for the ESI Virtual ED program. The goal is to replace the AmWell platform with eVisit for telehealth calls and ensure the success criteria for the pilot are met.
- The task also includes assessing pilot feedback, revenue projections, data analysis, and patient safety ratings related to the eVisit platform. Additionally, it involves justifying revenue calculations and obtaining testimonials/examples from virtual physicians and partners.

**Functionality/Purpose:**
The project aims to evaluate and implement a new eVisit software platform for telehealth calls, ensuring a smooth transition from the previous platform (AmWell). The focus is on technical cybersecurity reviews, pilot success criteria, revenue projections, and overall user satisfaction.
