### Step 1: Explicit Representation of Goal List
- The project goals include various aspects of cybersecurity such as cloud security, technical control testing, threat detection and analysis, insider threat management, data protection, infrastructure protection, application security, industry maturity based on NIST standards, policy management, risk management, compliance (e.g., PCI, HIPAA, GDPR), strategic governance, cybersecurity services management, budget efficiency, industry maturity according to NIST criteria, and various protection measures for different devices and data types. 

### Step 2: Semantic Meaning of Project Task
- The project involves integrating an NIH-provided iPad into a prospective study on Chronic Kidney Disease in Children. The focus of the task is to ensure secure data transfer of study questionnaire responses to the sponsor using the iPad while maintaining compliance and security protocols.
- Keywords: Cybersecurity, data transfer, study questionnaire, iPad, secure email configuration, de-identified data, data encryption, data security.

### Step 3: Project Purpose or Functionality
The purpose of the project task is to enhance the data transfer process within the Chronic Kidney Disease study by securely integrating an NIH-provided iPad for collecting and transferring de-identified study questionnaire responses. The project aims to ensure compliance, data encryption, and secure email configuration to facilitate secure data transfer to the sponsor.
