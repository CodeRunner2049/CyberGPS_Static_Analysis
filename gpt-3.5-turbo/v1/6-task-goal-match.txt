2. Project Task:
The project involves establishing a connection between the American Medical Association (AMA) and Forward Health Group with the Epic EMR system to study clinician activities. It includes not directly accessing patient data but observing clinician interactions, potentially requiring access to patient data as well.

3. Project Summary:
The project aims to facilitate a secure connection between the American Medical Association (AMA) and Forward Health Group's software with the Epic EMR system to study clinician activities. While the primary focus is on clinician interactions, there may be potential access to patient data, necessitating careful consideration of cybersecurity measures.

4. Probability Matching:
[Detect and analyze threats]
