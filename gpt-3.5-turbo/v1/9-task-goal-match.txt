### Step 1: Explicit Goal List Representation

- The project aims to protect critical cloud tenets.
- The project involves scanning cloud tenets.
- Remediation of cloud vulnerabilities is part of the project goals.
- The project intends to test technical controls.
- Recommendations for implementing technical control gaps are included in the project goals.

### Step 2: Project Task Semantic Meaning

Based on the description provided, the project task involves the installation and utility of an Elio server for bioinformatics analysis related to the PGDx/ctDNA based pan-cancer liquid biopsy. The data processed and stored is de-identified next-generation sequencing data. The hosting is on-premise, specifically on racks. The request also includes the installation of hardware, the PGDx elio server, which requires a network connection through Ethernet.

### Step 3: Project Functionality or Purpose

The project focuses on ensuring the secure design and engineering services for the installation and utilization of the Elio server for bioinformatics analysis related to the PGDx/ctDNA based pan-cancer liquid biopsy. It involves handling de-identified genetic sequencing data and configuring the network connection via Ethernet for secure data transmission.
