Step 1: 
Project Goals Summary:
- The project goals involve protecting data, networks, applications, and infrastructure.
- There is a focus on cybersecurity measures, compliance with regulations (such as HIPAA and GDPR), and industry maturity based on NIST guidelines.
- The goals also include mitigating risks, managing policies, ensuring business continuity, and engaging with various business units for cybersecurity.
- Additionally, there is an emphasis on cybersecurity services, budget efficiency, strategic governance reviews, and customer satisfaction.

Step 2:
Project Task Summary:
- The project involves the installation and utility of an Elio server for bioinformatics analysis in the context of PGDx/ctDNA based pan-cancer liquid biopsy.
- Data processed is de-identified NSG sequencing data hosted on-premise.
- The project requires the use of a PGDx Elio server and an Ethernet network connection.
- Contacts include Shadi Swaidani from Cleveland Clinic and Alex Shaw from PGDx.

Step 3:
The project focuses on implementing a secure design and engineering service for the installation and utility of an Elio server for bioinformatics analysis for PGDx/ctDNA based pan-cancer liquid biopsy. The project involves handling de-identified NSG sequencing data on-premise and ensuring secure data processing through the PGDx Elio server with an Ethernet network connection.
